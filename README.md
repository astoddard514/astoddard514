- 👋 Hi, I’m Angela Stoddard, mom of two young kids. Until last year, I worked in botany and agriculture - both fieldwork and laboratory work. 🔬 
- 👀 I’m interested in web and mobile applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very begining basics of programming (HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, C - as well as Github and the other primary developer tools).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, or anything that will be appropriate to help me grow or make an impact.
- Wish me luck!
