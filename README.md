- 👋 Hi, I’m Angela Stoddard, mom of two young kids. Until last year, I worked for 15 years in 🌿botany and 🐞agriculture - 🥾fieldwork  and 🔬laboratory work. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web and mobile applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very begining basics of programming (HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, C - as well as data structures and algorithms, Github and the other primary developer tools).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, or anything that will be appropriate to help me grow or make an impact.
- 🍀 Wish me luck! Send ⚡flow.
