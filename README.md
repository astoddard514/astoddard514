- 👋 Hi, I’m Angela Stoddard, a mom of two young children. Until last year, I worked in botany and agriculture - in the field and in the laboratory. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web and mobile applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very begining basics of programming (HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, C - and all of the other primary developer tools).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, or anything that will be appropriate to help me grow.
- 📫 Reach me at angela.haugen.stoddard@gmail.com.
